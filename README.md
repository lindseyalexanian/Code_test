## Details!
Most of the work is done in biointech.py (apologies for the typo in the name...). This script analyzes the data, prints it and writes the stats to outfile.txt. This script aso outputs rank.csv and scaled.csv, which includes the gene names with their ranks and scaled (per unit length), respectively.

The visualization was done in graph-it.R. I also copied this and pasted it into an Rmd file too. The visualization itself is in graph-it.png.
